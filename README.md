# Vasicek-model-project

This project reproduces and extends the OLS and MLE-based estimation of the Vasicek interest rate model using US 3-month Treasury rate data (GS3M). It follows the methodology presented in the report Estimation and Application of the Vasicek Interest Rate Model (Buffoli & Rolfi, 2025) and aims to deepen understanding of mean-reverting interest rate models in both discrete and continuous time.


ðŸ§¬ What This Project Covers

âœ… OLS Estimation of Discretized Vasicek

Transforms the continuous Vasicek SDE into its Euler-discretized form:

r_{t+1} = Î± + Î² r_t + Îµ_t

Estimates Î± and Î² via OLS and backs out Vasicek parameters:

a = (1 - Î²) / dtb = Î± / (1 - Î²)Ïƒ = std(Îµ) / sqrt(dt)

Produces estimates consistent with Table 1 of the report.

Residual analysis (heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation) reveals theoretical violations, confirming the paper's critique that assumptions often fail in practice.

âœ… MLE Estimation via Likelihood Maximization

Uses the exact conditional transition density:

r_{t+1} | r_t âˆ¼ Normal(Î¼, Q)

Î¼ = r_t e^{-a Î”t} + b(1 - e^{-a Î”t})Q = (Ïƒ^2 (1 - e^{-2aÎ”t})) / (2a)

Defines and minimizes the negative log-likelihood to obtain MLE estimates of a, b, and Ïƒ.

Statistically efficient under correct model assumptions.

ðŸ“ˆ Simulation

Simulates future short-term interest rates using both OLS and MLE parameters:

r_{t+1} = r_t + a(b - r_t)Î”t + Ïƒ âˆšÎ”t Â· Îµ_t

Graphs compare simulated paths with historical GS3M rates.

Simulations deviate from observed data, affirming the report's claim that Vasicek models often underperform due to weak mean-reversion or structural breaks.
